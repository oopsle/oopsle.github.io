		The OOPSLE workshop is
		a discussion-oriented and collaborative
		forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
		unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
		It can help you define your problems or verify them on the early stage with the community.
	</p>
	<p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
		languages used in software development: for programming,
		markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
		specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
		a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
		measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
		of such languages.
		The <a href="#cfp">call for panelists</a> can be found below.
	</p>
	<p>
		The OOPSLE workshop has successfully ran in
		<a href="../2013">2013</a>,
		<a href="../2014">2014</a> and
		<a href="../2015">2015</a>. It is scheduled to be run again in 2016.

	<h1 id="cfp">Call for panelists</h1>
	<p>
		In 2016 the workshop will comprise two keynote sessions, two panels
		and a overarching discussion. As traditional, both keynote speakers
		will be chosen from senior researchers known worldwide both in the
		reverse engineering and software language engineering communities, and
		invited personally: one will offer the academic perspective, the other
		will provide industrial one. We are actively looking for panelists —
		position statements are collected through EasyChair (1–2 page <a
		href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE
		style</a>) on the following two sets of topics:
	</p>
	<blockquote id="parapanel">
		<h2>Language-Parametric Panel</h2>
		<p>
			Software language engineers have developed many methods and tools
			during the last decade, meant for both forward and reverse
			engineering: we create domain-specific languages, manipulate their
			definitions, cotransform related artefacts, analyse involved entities
			for a variety of causes, mine useful facts from codebases, boost
			performance of our algorithms, introduce new theories and challenge
			long-standing ones.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, many questions remain pertaining language-parametricity
			of our techniques and interoperability of our tools. Please submit
			your position statement to this panel contributing on any of the
			following topics:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Software language agnostic engineering</li>
			<li>Assessing applicability of software language engineering methods and tools</li>
			<li>Framework interoperability and interchange formats</li>
			<li>Experience reports on non-trivial combination of methods</li>
			<li>Language-specific configurations of methods and tools</li>
			<li>Anything else related to the view of a software language being just another input</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>
	<hr/>
	<blockquote id="slecopanel">
		<h2>Software Language Ecosystems Panel</h2>
		<p>
			Just like overly zealous software developers tend to overlook
			stakeholder interests and user experience, software language
			designers are not used to continually reminding themselves about
			the ecosystems their languages are a part of. Considerably more
			effort is put into making a transformation semantic preserving or
			ensuring orthogonality of language constructs, than into
			considering language integration schemes and weighing the impact
			of language adaptation on the software process.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is time to address such issues even in more detail than they
			have been repeatedly addressed during previous OOPSLE sessions.
			Please submit your position statement to this panel contributing
			on any of the following topics:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Software language interaction with cyber-physical systems</li>
			<li>Guiding system and language comprehension with megamodel renarrations</li>
			<li>Language and language artefact adaptability to the needs of language users</li>
			<li>Software language modularity and decompositionality on the end user's side</li>
			<li>Learnability of a software language and teaching software language engineering</li>
			<li>Anything else related to the environment and context of software languages</li>
		</ul>
