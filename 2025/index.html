		The OOPSLE workshop is
		a discussion-oriented and collaborative
		forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
		unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
		It can help you define your problems or verify them on the early stage with the community.
	</p>
	<p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
		languages used in software development: for programming,
		markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
		specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
		a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
		measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
		of such languages.
	</p>
	<p>
		The OOPSLE workshop has successfully ran in
		<a href="../2013/index.html">2013</a>,
		<a href="../2014/index.html">2014</a>,
		<a href="../2015/index.html">2015</a>,
		<a href="../2016/index.html">2016</a> and
		<a href="../2020/index.html">2020</a>.
		We resume the series in the post-pandemic world, promising
		to keep the spirit of the original editions with the emphasis
		on discussions and a versatile cast of participants.

			<ul>
				<li><em><b>Adressing the “Engineering” in “Software Language Engineering”</b></em></li>
				<blockquote>Up to now, the development of new software languages has remained
largely an artisanal process, reminiscent of the state of software
engineering half a century ago.<br/>
To bring a more systematic, engineering-oriented methodology to the
definition of software languages, we address several critical
challenges. These include the lack of formal semantics, the absence of
reusable language libraries, and the difficulties enabling
compositionality, extensibility, and variant management in both
languages and their associated tools. We also review the current state
of the art and explore potential solutions to these issues.</blockquote>

			13:30 – 14:30 <strong>Jordi Cabot</strong>, keynote (<a href="https://modeling-languages.com/vibe-dsling/">slides</a>)
			<ul>
				<li><em><b>Who will create the languages of the future? (hint: probably not a team of language engineers!)</b></em></li>
				<blockquote>Software is eating the world. Which means that we need good languages to write all this software. And, often, come up with “new” languages to be able to efficiently target new software domains and technologies. In this talk, we will explore the changing landscape of language engineering and discuss how Artificial Intelligence and low-code/no-code techniques can play a role in this future by helping in the definition, use, execution, and testing of new languages. Even empowering non-tech users to create their own language infrastructure. Maybe without them even realizing.</blockquote>

			15:30 – 16:30 <strong>Antonio Cicchetti</strong>, keynote
			<ul>
				<li><em><b>Let’s Make Abstraction Engineering Fun Again</b></em></li>
				<blockquote>Model-Driven Engineering has witnessed a technological revolution with the advent of rich web interfaces. A part of the consequences is visible in the widespread adoption of Low-/No-code development platforms. From a software language engineering perspective, nowadays many language workbenches are web-based (or provide a web-based alternative). In this talk I will discuss recent experiences with the development and adoption of a “native” web-based language workbench called JJODEL. In particular, the advanced web interfaces disclose the support for interesting MDE-relevant features, notably flexible concrete syntaxes, language co-evolution, and collaborative development.</blockquote>
