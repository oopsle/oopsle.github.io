Call for Position Papers</h3>

<p>
You are invited to submit a position paper up to 4 pages in length,
sketching an open or original problem, idea or challenge. Submissions
are screened by the workshop chairs, who will select papers based on
potential for discussion and interest to the community, as well as the
clarity of presentation and motivation.

<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is not necessary
for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers will be posted online prior
to the workshop, so the participants have the opportunity to read them in
advance.

<h3>
<a name="topics" class="anchor" href="#topics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
Relevant Topics</h3>

We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of examples
of topics of interests of the workshop:

<ul>
<li> Defining an unsolved problem by establishing both its provenance in
	prior research and the lack of a fully satisfactory solution.
<li> Identifying new problem areas in software language engineering that
	have not been previously studied due to lack of understanding,
	techniques, practical interest or scalability issues.
<li> Engaging in technological space travel by identifying similar problems
	in various sectors of software language engineering (i.e., grammarware,
	modelware, ontoware, XMLware, databases, spreadsheets, etc).
<li> Generalising and reformulating of several well-known problems into
	several sides of one open challenge (e.g., parsing and
	pretty-printing).
<li> Proposing systematic methods of assessment and comparison of existing
	and emerging solutions to a problem that is not or cannot be fully
	solved (e.g., choosing between parsing techniques, metaprogramming
	methodologies, software language workbenches).
<li> Arguing about definitions of terms commonly used in various senses
	(e.g., software language design, quality of a grammar, transformation).
<li> Presenting unconventional crossovers of popular research topics and
	software language engineering concerns (e.g., green IDEs and energy
	consumption considerations for parsing algorithms).
<li> Making an overview of major hindrances hindering solution of a
	standing problem (e.g., tool interoperability and reuse, tackling
	language and metalanguage diversity and versatility, consistency
	management).
<li> Designing open datasets in the software language engineering domain
	and the way we could share and incorporate them.
<li> Describing novel or unconventional ideas that are promising but are
	not yet fully validated, or where validation itself may be a challenge.
<li> Revealing solid negative results, failed experiments and disproven
hypotheses.
<li> Constructing future community experiments and considering topics our
	community expects to see addressed by such a competition, if one
	decides to run it in the future.
<li> Critically reassessing a problem that is widely assumed to be solved
	but the solution is either underwhelming or could be “considered
	harmful” (model-driven engineering, domain-specific languages,
	test-based development).
<ul>

Workshop Format</h3>

<p>
Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief summary of its
main idea and a set of open questions to be discussed with the
audience. Presenters will ask for input on how to proceed with experiments,
validation or refinement of their ideas, collect opinions on the presented
definitions, share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may lead to
deepening the initially presented insights. The workshop is planned to have
short presentations and long discussions to stimulate direct collaboration
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit a full paper
to a special issue of the Electronic Communications of the EASST, an open
access peer-reviewed journal (negotiations underway). Journal submissions
will undergo peer review by the members of the program committee consisting
of researchers in software language engineering and reverse engineering.
