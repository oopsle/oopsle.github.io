<p>
  This workshop is meant to expose hidden expertise in coping with
  unsolvable or unsolved problems which commonly remain unexposed in academic
  publications. OOPSLE aims to serve as a think tank in selecting candidates
  for the open problem list, as well as other kinds of unconventional
  questions and definitions that do not necessarily have clear answers or
  solutions, thus facilitating the exposure of dark
  data~\cite{DarkData2007}. We also plan to formulate promising
  language-related challenges to organise in the future. Beside the
  abovementioned POPLmark Challenge which can also be seen as a collection of
  benchmarks, there have been many more contests, challenges and competitions
  related to software language engineering: LDTA Tool Challenge held at the
  LDTA workshop in 2011~\cite{LDTA2011TC}, CodeGeneration-affiliated Language
  Workbench Challenge~\cite{LWC2013} held yearly since 2011, Transformation
  Tool Contest held six times since 2007~\cite{Rensink10}, Rewrite Engines
  Competition held three times in 2006, 2008 and 2010 at WRLA~\cite{REC2010},
  PLT Games held monthly since December 2012~\cite{PLT}.

  Call for Position Papers</h3>

		  <p>
			You are invited to submit a position paper up to 4 pages in length,
			sketching an open or original problem, idea or challenge. Submissions
			are screened by the workshop chairs, who will select papers based on
			potential for discussion and interest to the community, as well as the
			clarity of presentation and motivation.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is not necessary
			for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers will be posted online prior
			to the workshop, so the participants have the opportunity to read them in
			advance.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			Papers should be formatted according to
			the <a href="http://easychair.org/coolnews.cgi">EasyChair LaTeX class
			  style</a> and submitted via EasyChair (link TBA).
		  </p>

		  <h3>
			<a name="topics" class="anchor" href="#topics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
			Relevant Topics</h3>

		  We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of examples
		  of topics of interests of the workshop:

		  <ul>
			<li> Defining an <em>unsolved problem</em> by establishing both its
			  provenance in prior research and the lack of a fully satisfactory
			  solution.
			<li> Identifying <em>new problem areas</em> in software language
			  engineering that have not been previously studied due to lack of
			  understanding, techniques, practical interest or scalability issues.
			<li> Engaging in <em>technological space travel</em> by identifying similar
			  problems in various sectors of software language engineering (i.e.,
			  grammarware, modelware, ontoware, XMLware, databases, spreadsheets,
			  etc).
			<li> <em>Generalising and reformulating</em> of several well-known problems
			  into several sides of one open challenge (e.g., parsing and
			  pretty-printing).
			<li> Proposing systematic methods of <em>assessment and comparison</em> of
			  existing and emerging solutions to a problem that is not or cannot be
			  fully solved (e.g., choosing between parsing techniques,
			  metaprogramming methodologies, software language workbenches).
			<li> Arguing about <em>definitions of terms</em> commonly used in various
			  senses (e.g., software language design, quality of a grammar,
			  transformation).
			<li> Presenting <em>unconventional crossovers</em> of popular research
			  topics and software language engineering concerns (e.g., green IDEs and
			  energy consumption considerations for parsing algorithms).
			<li> Making an overview of <em>major hindrances</em> hindering solution of
			  a standing problem (e.g., tool interoperability and reuse, tackling
			  language and metalanguage diversity and versatility, consistency
			  management).
			<li> <em>Designing open datasets</em> in the software language engineering
			  domain and the way we could share and incorporate them.
			<li> Describing <em>novel or unconventional</em> ideas that are promising
			  but are not yet fully validated, or where validation itself may be a
			  challenge.
			<li> Revealing <em>solid negative results</em>, failed experiments and
			  disproven hypotheses.
			<li> Constructing future <em>community experiments</em> and considering
			  topics our community expects to see addressed by such a competition, if
			  one decides to run it in the future.
			<li> <em>Critically reassessing</em> a problem that is widely assumed to be
			  solved but the solution is either underwhelming or could be “considered
			  harmful” (model-driven engineering, domain-specific languages,
			  test-based development).
			  <ul>

				  Workshop Format</h3>

				<p>
				  Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief summary of its
				  main idea and a set of open questions to be discussed with the
				  audience. Presenters will ask for input on how to proceed with experiments,
				  validation or refinement of their ideas, collect opinions on the presented
				  definitions, share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
				  friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may lead to
				  deepening the initially presented insights. The workshop is planned to have
				  short presentations and long discussions to stimulate direct collaboration
				  afterwards.
				</p>

				<p>
				  After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit a full paper
				  to a special issue of the Electronic Communications of the EASST, an open
				  access peer-reviewed journal (negotiations underway). Journal submissions
				  will undergo peer review by the members of the program committee consisting
				  of researchers in software language engineering and reverse engineering.
