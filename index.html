		  <p>
			The OOPSLE workshop is a discussion-oriented and collaborative
			forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
			unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
		  </p>

		  <p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
			languages used in software development: for programming,
			markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
			specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
			a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
			measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
			of such languages.
		  </p>

		  <p>Please study the <a href="#topics">list of topics</a>
		  below and the <a href="papers/oopsle.pdf">workshop description
		  (PDF)</a> for more information.</p>

		  <h1 id="call-for-papers">Call for Position Papers</h1>

		  <p>
			You are invited to submit a position paper up to 4 pages in
			length, sketching an open or original problem, idea or
			challenge. Submissions are screened by the workshop chairs, who
			will select papers based on potential for discussion and
			interest to the community, as well as the clarity of
			presentation and motivation.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is
			not necessary for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers
			will be posted online prior to the workshop, so the
			participants have the opportunity to read them in advance.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			Papers should be formatted according to
			the <a href="http://easychair.org/coolnews.cgi">EasyChair LaTeX
			  class style</a> and submitted via EasyChair (link TBA).
		  </p>

		  <h1 id="topics">Relevant Topics</h1>

		  We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of
		  examples of topics of interests of the workshop:

		  <ul>
			<li> Defining an <em>unsolved problem</em> by establishing both
			  its provenance in prior research and the lack of a fully
			  satisfactory solution.
			<li> Identifying <em>new problem areas</em> in software
			  language engineering that have not been previously studied
			  due to lack of understanding, techniques, practical interest
			  or scalability issues.
			<li> Engaging in <em>technological space travel</em> by
			  identifying similar problems in various sectors of software
			  language engineering (i.e., grammarware, modelware, ontoware,
			  XMLware, databases, spreadsheets, etc).
			<li> <em>Generalising and reformulating</em> of several
			  well-known problems into several sides of one open challenge
			  (e.g., parsing and pretty-printing).
			<li> Proposing systematic methods of <em>assessment and
				comparison</em> of existing and emerging solutions to a
			  problem that is not or cannot be fully solved (e.g., choosing
			  between parsing techniques, metaprogramming methodologies,
			  software language workbenches).
			<li> Arguing about <em>definitions of terms</em> commonly used
			  in various senses (e.g., software language design, quality of
			  a grammar, transformation).
			<li> Presenting <em>unconventional crossovers</em> of popular
			  research topics and software language engineering concerns
			  (e.g., green IDEs and energy consumption considerations for
			  parsing algorithms).
			<li> Making an overview of <em>major hindrances</em> hindering
			  solution of a standing problem (e.g., tool interoperability
			  and reuse, tackling language and metalanguage diversity and
			  versatility, consistency management).
			<li> <em>Designing open datasets</em> in the software language
			  engineering domain and the way we could share and incorporate
			  them.
			<li> Describing <em>novel or unconventional</em> ideas that are
			  promising but are not yet fully validated, or where
			  validation itself may be a challenge.
			<li> Revealing <em>solid negative results</em>, failed
			  experiments and disproven hypotheses.
			<li> Constructing future <em>community experiments</em> and
			  considering topics our community expects to see addressed by
			  such a competition, if one decides to run it in the future.
			<li> <em>Critically reassessing</em> a problem that is widely
			  assumed to be solved but the solution is either underwhelming
			  or could be “considered harmful” (model-driven engineering,
			  domain-specific languages, test-based development).
		  </ul>

		  <h1 id="format">Workshop Format</h1>

		  <p>
			Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief
			summary of its main idea and a set of open questions to be
			discussed with the audience. Presenters will ask for input on
			how to proceed with experiments, validation or refinement of
			their ideas, collect opinions on the presented definitions,
			share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
			friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may
			lead to deepening the initially presented insights. The
			workshop is planned to have short presentations and long
			discussions to stimulate direct collaboration afterwards.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit
			a full paper to a special issue of the Electronic
			Communications of the EASST, an open access peer-reviewed
			journal (negotiations underway). Journal submissions will
			undergo peer review by the members of the program committee
			consisting of researchers in software language engineering and
			reverse engineering.
