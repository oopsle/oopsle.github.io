                   *** CALL FOR POSITION PAPERS ***                     

Everyone is invited to submit a position paper up to 4 pages in length,
sketching an open or original problem, idea or challenge. Submissions are
screened by the workshop chairs, who will select papers based on potential
for discussion and interest to the community, as well as the clarity of
presentation and motivation.

OOPSLE is not a mini-conference, and therefore it is not necessary for the
work to be conclusive yet. The papers will be posted online prior to the
workshop, so the participants have the opportunity to read them in advance.

Papers should submitted electronically via EasyChair.

Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief summary of its
main idea and a set of open questions to be discussed with the 
audience. Presenters will ask for input on how to proceed with experiments,
validation or refinement of their ideas, collect opinions on the presented
definitions, share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may lead to
deepening the initially presented insights. The workshop is planned to have
short presentations and long discussions to stimulate direct collaboration
afterwards.

After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit a full paper
to a special issue in a peer-reviewed journal. Those submissions will
undergo peer review by the members of the program committee consisting of
researchers in software language engineering and reverse engineering.

** Relevant topics **

We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of examples
of topics of interests of the workshop:

* Defining an unsolved problem by establishing both its provenance in prior
  research and the lack of a fully satisfactory solution.

* Identifying new problem areas in software language engineering that have
  not been previously studied due to lack of understanding, techniques,
  practical interest or scalability issues.

* Engaging in technological space travel by identifying similar problems in
  various sectors of software language engineering (i.e., grammarware,
  modelware, ontoware, XMLware, databases, spreadsheets, etc).

* Generalising and reformulating of several well-known problems into
  several sides of one open challenge (e.g., parsing and pretty-printing).

* Proposing systematic methods of assessment and comparison of existing and
  emerging solutions to a problem that is not or cannot be fully solved
  (e.g., choosing between parsing techniques, metaprogramming
  methodologies, software language workbenches).

* Arguing about definitions of terms commonly used in various senses (e.g.,
  software language design, quality of a grammar, transformation).

* Presenting unconventional crossovers of popular research topics and
  software language engineering concerns (e.g., green IDEs and energy
  consumption considerations for parsing algorithms).

* Making an overview of major hindrances hindering solution of a standing
  problem (e.g., tool interoperability and reuse, tackling language and
  metalanguage diversity and versatility, consistency management).

* Designing open datasets in the software language engineering domain and
  the way we could share and incorporate them.

* Describing novel or unconventional ideas that are promising but are not
  yet fully validated, or where validation itself may be a challenge.

* Revealing solid negative results, failed experiments and disproven
  hypotheses.

* Constructing future community experiments and considering topics our
  community expects to see addressed by such a competition, if one decides
  to run it in the future.

* Critically reassessing a problem that is widely assumed to be solved but
  the solution is either underwhelming or could be “considered harmful”
  (model-driven engineering, domain-specific languages, test-based
  development).
