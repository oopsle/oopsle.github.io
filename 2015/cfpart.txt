                   *** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***                     

The OOPSLE workshop is a discussion-oriented and collaborative forum for
formulating and addressing open, unsolved and unsolvable problems in software
language engineering. It can help you define and refine your problems or
verify them on the early stage with the community.

“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial languages used in
software development: for programming, markup, pretty-printing, modelling,
data description, formal specification, evolution, etc. Software language
engineering is a relatively novel research domain of systematic, disciplined
and measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance of such
languages.

The third OOPSLE workshop will be held in connection with SANER 2015, in
Montréal, Canada, on 6 March 2015, and will feature a keynote by Jim
Cordy as well as a lineup of invited talks. As usual, OOPSLE will be
discussion-oriented, with presenters asking for input on how to proceed
with experiments, validation or refinement of their ideas, collect opinions
on the presented definitions, share similar experience and so on. We expect
the participants to be friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions
back that may lead to deepening the initially presented insights. The
workshop is planned to have short presentations and long discussions to
stimulate direct collaboration afterwards.

We plan to continue our discussion at the informal after-workshop dinner.
