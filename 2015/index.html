				<!-- <h1 id="about">About OOPSLE</h1> -->

			<p>
				The <a href="oopsle14.pdf">OOPSLE workshop</a> is
				a discussion-oriented and collaborative
				forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
				unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
				It can help you define your problems or verify them on the early stage with the community.
			</p>
			<p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
				languages used in software development: for programming,
				markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
				specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
				a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
				measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
				of such languages.
				The detailed <a href="#topics">list of possible topics</a>
				and the <a href="#cfp">call for papers</a>
				can be found below.

			<h1 id="cfp">Call for papers</h1>
			<!-- <p>
				(See also the <a href="cfp.pdf">distributable call for papers</a> for an encouraging workshop definition).
			</p> -->
			<p>
				Everyone is invited to submit a position paper up to <em>4 pages</em>
				in length, sketching an open or original problem, idea or
				challenge. Submissions are screened by the workshop chairs, who
				will select papers based on potential for discussion and
				interest to the community, as well as the clarity of
				presentation and motivation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is
				not necessary for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers
				will be posted online prior to the workshop, so the
				participants have the opportunity to read them in advance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Papers should be formatted according to
				the <a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/template/">EC-EASST
				style</a> and <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=oopsle2015">submitted electronically via EasyChair</a>.
				The cover page is automatically produced and does not count towards the page limit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief
				summary of its main idea and a set of open questions to be
				discussed with the audience. Presenters will ask for input on
				how to proceed with experiments, validation or refinement of
				their ideas, collect opinions on the presented definitions,
				share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
				friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may
				lead to deepening the initially presented insights. The
				workshop is planned to have short presentations and long
				discussions to stimulate direct collaboration afterwards.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit
				a full paper to a special issue of the <a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php/eceasst/index">Electronic
				Communications of the EASST</a>, an open access peer-reviewed
				journal. Journal submissions will
				undergo peer review by the members of the program committee
				consisting of researchers in software language engineering and
				reverse engineering.
			</p>

			<h1 id="topics">Relevant topics</h1>

			<p>We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of
			examples of topics of interests of the workshop:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Defining an <em>unsolved problem</em> by establishing both
					its provenance in prior research and the lack of a fully
					satisfactory solution.</li>
				<li>Identifying <em>new problem areas</em> in software
					language engineering that have not been previously studied
					due to lack of understanding, techniques, practical interest
					or scalability issues.</li>
				<li>Engaging in <em>technological space travel</em> by
					identifying similar problems in various sectors of software
					language engineering (i.e., grammarware, modelware, ontoware,
					XMLware, databases, spreadsheets, etc).</li>
				<li><em>Generalising and reformulating</em> of several
					well-known problems into several sides of one open challenge
					(e.g., parsing and pretty-printing).</li>
				<li>Proposing systematic methods of <em>assessment and
					comparison</em> of existing and emerging solutions to a
					problem that is not or cannot be fully solved (e.g., choosing
					between parsing techniques, metaprogramming methodologies,
					software language workbenches).</li>
				<li>Arguing about <em>definitions of terms</em> commonly used
					in various senses (e.g., software language design, quality of
					a grammar, transformation).</li>
				<li>Presenting <em>unconventional crossovers</em> of popular
					research topics and software language engineering concerns
					(e.g., green IDEs and energy consumption considerations for
					parsing algorithms).</li>
				<li>Making an overview of <em>major hindrances</em> hindering
					solution of a standing problem (e.g., tool interoperability
					and reuse, tackling language and metalanguage diversity and
					versatility, consistency management).</li>
				<li><em>Designing open datasets</em> in the software language
					engineering domain and the way we could share and incorporate
					them.</li>
				<li>Describing <em>novel or unconventional</em> ideas that are
					promising but are not yet fully validated, or where
					validation itself may be a challenge.</li>
				<li>Revealing <em>solid negative results</em>, failed
					experiments and disproven hypotheses.</li>
				<li>Constructing future <em>community experiments</em> and
					considering topics our community expects to see addressed by
					such a competition, if one decides to run it in the future.</li>
				<li><em>Critically reassessing</em> a problem that is widely
					assumed to be solved but the solution is either underwhelming
					or could be “considered harmful” (model-driven engineering,
					domain-specific languages, test-based development).</li>
			</ul>
