		<!-- <h1 id="about">About OOPSLE</h1> -->

	<p>
		The OOPSLE workshop is
		a discussion-oriented and collaborative
		forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
		unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
		It can help you define your problems or verify them on the early stage with the community.
	</p>
	<p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
		languages used in software development: for programming,
		markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
		specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
		a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
		measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
		of such languages.
		The detailed <a href="#topics">list of possible topics</a>
		and the <a href="#cfp">call for papers</a>
		can be found below.

	<h1 id="cfp">Call for papers</h1>
	<p>
		(See also the <a href="cfp.txt">distributable call for papers</a> for an encouraging workshop definition).
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone is invited to submit a position paper up to <em>4 pages</em>
		in length, sketching an open or original problem, idea or
		challenge. Submissions are screened by the workshop chairs, who
		will select papers based on potential for discussion and
		interest to the community, as well as the clarity of
		presentation and motivation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is
		not necessary for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers
		will be posted online prior to the workshop, so the
		participants have the opportunity to read them in advance.
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/template/ -->
		Papers should be formatted according to
		the <a href="ECEASST-cls-XXX-OOPSLE2015.zip">EC-EASST
		style</a> and <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=oopsle2015">submitted electronically via EasyChair</a>.
		The cover page is automatically produced and does not count towards the page limit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief
		summary of its main idea and a set of open questions to be
		discussed with the audience. Presenters will ask for input on
		how to proceed with experiments, validation or refinement of
		their ideas, collect opinions on the presented definitions,
		share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
		friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may
		lead to deepening the initially presented insights. The
		workshop is planned to have short presentations and long
		discussions to stimulate direct collaboration afterwards.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit
		a full paper to a special issue of the <a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php/eceasst/index">Electronic
		Communications of the EASST</a>, an open access peer-reviewed
		journal. Journal submissions will
		undergo peer review by the members of the program committee
		consisting of researchers in software language engineering and
		reverse engineering.
	</p>

	<h1 id="topics">Relevant topics</h1>

	<p>We acknowledge the following list as non-exhaustive collection of
	examples of topics of interests of the workshop:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Defining an <em>unsolved problem</em> by establishing both
			its provenance in prior research and the lack of a fully
			satisfactory solution.</li>
		<li>Identifying <em>new problem areas</em> in software
			language engineering that have not been previously studied
			due to lack of understanding, techniques, practical interest
			or scalability issues.</li>
		<li>Engaging in <em>technological space travel</em> by
			identifying similar problems in various sectors of software
			language engineering (i.e., grammarware, modelware, ontoware,
			XMLware, databases, spreadsheets, etc).</li>
		<li><em>Generalising and reformulating</em> of several
			well-known problems into several sides of one open challenge
			(e.g., parsing and pretty-printing).</li>
		<li>Proposing systematic methods of <em>assessment and
			comparison</em> of existing and emerging solutions to a
			problem that is not or cannot be fully solved (e.g., choosing
			between parsing techniques, metaprogramming methodologies,
			software language workbenches).</li>
		<li>Arguing about <em>definitions of terms</em> commonly used
			in various senses (e.g., software language design, quality of
			a grammar, transformation).</li>
		<li>Presenting <em>unconventional crossovers</em> of popular
			research topics and software language engineering concerns
			(e.g., green IDEs and energy consumption considerations for
			parsing algorithms).</li>
		<li>Making an overview of <em>major hindrances</em> hindering
			solution of a standing problem (e.g., tool interoperability
			and reuse, tackling language and metalanguage diversity and
			versatility, consistency management).</li>
		<li><em>Designing open datasets</em> in the software language
			engineering domain and the way we could share and incorporate
			them.</li>
		<li>Describing <em>novel or unconventional</em> ideas that are
			promising but are not yet fully validated, or where
			validation itself may be a challenge.</li>
		<li>Revealing <em>solid negative results</em>, failed
			experiments and disproven hypotheses.</li>
		<li>Constructing future <em>community experiments</em> and
			considering topics our community expects to see addressed by
			such a competition, if one decides to run it in the future.</li>
		<li><em>Critically reassessing</em> a problem that is widely
			assumed to be solved but the solution is either underwhelming
			or could be “considered harmful” (model-driven engineering,
			domain-specific languages, test-based development).</li>
	</ul>
