		  <p>
			The OOPSLE workshop is a discussion-oriented and collaborative
			forum for formulating and addressing with open, unsolved and
			unsolvable problems in software language engineering.
			It can help you define your problems or verify them on the early stage with the community.
		  </p>

		  <p>“Software languages” comprise all kinds of artificial
			languages used in software development: for programming,
			markup, pretty-printing, modelling, data description, formal
			specification, evolution, etc. Software language engineering is
			a relatively new research domain of systematic, disciplined and
			measurable approaches of development, evolution and maintenance
			of such languages.
			The detailed list of possible topics can be found <a href="http://oopsle.github.io/">on our website</a>.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			Everyone is invited to submit a position paper up to <em>4 pages</em> in
			length, sketching an open or original problem, idea or
			challenge. Submissions are screened by the workshop chairs, who
			will select papers based on potential for discussion and
			interest to the community, as well as the clarity of
			presentation and motivation.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			<em>OOPSLE is not a mini-conference</em>, and therefore it is
			not necessary for the work to be conclusive yet. The papers
			will be posted online prior to the workshop, so the
			participants have the opportunity to read them in advance.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			Papers should be formatted according to
			the <a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/template/">EC-EASST
			style</a> and <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=oopsle2014">submitted electronically via EasyChair</a>.
			The cover page is automatically produced and does not count towards the page limit.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			Each accepted paper is presented at the workshop as a brief
			summary of its main idea and a set of open questions to be
			discussed with the audience. Presenters will ask for input on
			how to proceed with experiments, validation or refinement of
			their ideas, collect opinions on the presented definitions,
			share similar experience. We expect the participants to be
			friendly but inquisitive, and ask hard questions back that may
			lead to deepening the initially presented insights. The
			workshop is planned to have short presentations and long
			discussions to stimulate direct collaboration afterwards.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			After the workshop, all participants will be invited to submit
			a full paper to a special issue of the <a href="http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/index.php/eceasst/index">Electronic
			Communications of the EASST</a>, an open access peer-reviewed
			journal (negotiations underway). Journal submissions will
			undergo peer review by the members of the program committee
			consisting of researchers in software language engineering and
			reverse engineering.
